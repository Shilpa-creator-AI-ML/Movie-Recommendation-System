# Movie-Recommendation-System
The movie recommendation system loads and merges movies.csv and credits.csv, extracts features like genres, cast, and crew, combines them into tags, vectorizes them using CountVectorizer, and computes cosine similarity. A recommend function returns the top 5 similar movies.
